Branch structure
----------------

The repository is made up of two main branches: master (stable) and dev (unstable).

* **master** has the latest stable code, its tags are released as [SeriesGuide][1] on Google Play.
* **dev** includes the latest unstable code from contributers (you!).

Setup
-----

This project is built with Gradle, the [Android Gradle plugin][3] and uses jars or Maven dependencies. Clone this repository inside your working folder. Import the settings.gradle file in the root folder into e.g. Android Studio. (You can also have a look at the build.gradle files on how the projects depend on another.)

Before your first build create `gradle.properties` in the root directory (where settings.gradle is), add the following values (do not need to be valid if you do not plan to use that functionality):

```
// used for publishing the API jar
ossrhUsername=<your sonatype username>
ossrhPassword=<your sonatype password>

TMDB_API_KEY=<your api key>
TRAKT_API_KEY=<your api key>
TVDB_API_KEY=<your api key>
TVTAG_CLIENT_ID=<your client id>
TVTAG_CLIENT_SECRET=<your client secret>
CRASHLYTICS_KEY=<a crashlytics api key>

// Play Store in-app billing public key
IAP_KEY_A=dummy
IAP_KEY_B=dummy
IAP_KEY_C=dummy
IAP_KEY_D=dummy
```

Now build any variant of the free flavor (flavor + build type, see [instructions about product flavors][5]) defined in `SeriesGuide/build.gradle`.
